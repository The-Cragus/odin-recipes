        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>2 large bone-in chicken breasts, skin removed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil</li>
            <li>3 carrots, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>1 onion diced</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked rice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon curry paste</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 cubes chicken bouillon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water and chicken in a large pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and cook until 
                chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. Remove chicken from the pot, 
                cut off meat from bones, and dice. Strain cooking broth through a sieve and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat coconut oil in a separate pot over medium heat. Add carrots, onion, and bell pepper; cook until softened, 
                5 to 7 minutes. Stir in cooked rice, brown sugar, curry paste, and diced chicken. 
                Cook and stir until curry paste is completely incorporated, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, and bouillon cubes. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. 
                Reduce heat and simmer until flavors are well combined, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
